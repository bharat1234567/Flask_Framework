This is a flask framework tutorial.
It contain working scripts which you can see and understand. I always find it interesting.
I have created it such that every js file will go in static folder. every html will go in template folder.
and all script will sit in mail application folder.
If you find any mistake in the code or any suggestion for improvements please write me on : bharatkumarmakhija14@gmail.com
